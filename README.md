### There are many things still a work in progress in this repo, and many that I would structure differently had I more time. However, I developed a deeper understanding of the PHP Backend stack and the basic architecture of 'data retrieval' type apps.

- Separate Reducers to maintain different state for each filter 'card'
- Change the logic for 'Selecting All' due align with best UX
- Seek clarification on data logic when applying multiple filters:
    i.e Fruit name, classification, month, AND a region name are checked off. What does that mean the user wants?
- Receive Data on the back end, send back SQL
- Convert Data in Charting Library
